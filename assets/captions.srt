1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,890
VueDC is an idea that Ben and I had long running. So my

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,970
name is Christian Guirreri and I met some 

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,340
of you as you came in

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:13,440
I'm a Senior Front-end Developer here on

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:17,279
JavaScript mainly. Ben Hong, Senior UI

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,720
Engineer, so he's going to be

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,550
speaking today and he's going to going over

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,640
a 101 on VueJS. Ben really

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,189
spearheaded this event, honestly he

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,869
really made it happen, so looking forward

11
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,590
to it and we're just really happy to have so

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,149
many people here. So why VueDC? We

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,980
didn't see that anyone else had a 

14
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:44,149
Vue DC specifically and Politico spent

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,899
a lot of time, probably the past year to

16
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:48,239
looking at different JavaScript

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,430
frameworks and we've really kind of

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,719
narrowed down on Vue. We have

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,120
used a few different ones for a few

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,870
different products but our best products

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,210
I think were probably done in Vue. We do a

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,649
lot of native

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,500
JavaScript as well like we're trying to

24
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,840
trim down as much as possible but Vue

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,610
has been a really nice framework really

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,170
nice structure and been really

27
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:16,979
dependable for us. So we've kind of

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,890
decided to use that in the future. We could

29
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,450
easily have a talk I think on 

30
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,439
comparing some of the frameworks and why

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,640
we've chosen Vue. We've kind of started

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,200
this group just to initiate the

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,670
discussion, have meetups like this one

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,189
where it's just you know introductory

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,640
to get people interested but

36
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:46,740
also more advanced topics obviously are

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:48,780
going to be coming. So VueConf, a few

38
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,110
announcements, since we should like all

39
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,909
meetups, should do the announcements thing,

40
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,100
VueConf US is coming up highly recommend

41
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:01,100
going all the famous people are going to

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:05,159
be there. [Where is it?] It is in New Orleans in March

43
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:09,330
So there's a workshop day on March

44
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,350
26th Monday, and then the conference is

45
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,870
Tuesday and Wednesday March 27 to 28.

46
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,550
So last year they did the first

47
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,040
official Vue conference I don't know

48
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:21,300
what makes it official I guess Evan

49
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,950
You is probably involved in that

50
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,680
official title but that was in Poland

51
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,250
and it's not here but there was a

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,060
YouTube channel that you can find I

53
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:37,630
there's a YouTube channel that you can

54
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:42,670
find that has all of the all of the

55
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,900
talks so we hope to see you there Ben

56
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,180
and I will both definitely be there so

57
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:52,570
sign up. So the next meetup is going to be

58
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,490
by me it'll be more of 201 it will sort

59
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:57,190
of continue a lot of what Ben is going

60
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,930
over today that's kind of how I like to

61
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,280
see see things going especially in

62
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:05,470
introductory phases but they're probably

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,310
fun so we hope you can all come back

64
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:13,450
with that and obviously any interest in

65
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,530
speaking come to Ben and me we're

66
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,270
definitely interested in hearing your

67
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,800
thoughts about any future meetups any

68
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,690
future talks stuff that you guys are

69
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,190
doing at your companies and if you need

70
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:29,600
any help like crafting a presentation

just reach out to us at vuejsdc@gmail.com

72
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:39,070
[Music]

73
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,260
We are interested in getting sponsors. We

74
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:46,360
want to make this a pretty big deal in

75
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:48,160
the area so you know you know of anybody

76
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,950
who's willing to sponsor either venue or

77
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,050
food or anything like that again reach

78
00:03:50,950 --> 00:04:02,560
out to Ben or myself

79
00:03:53,050 --> 00:04:05,350
but today's gold sponsor is Politico and

80
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,950
so I'd like to introduce you to Maria

81
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,530
Harrigan

82
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:15,750
she is a Talent Acquisition Manager at

83
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:15,750
Politico. Hi everyone. I'm so excited I get a whole slide

84
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:22,539
I know you didn't come to hear me talk and I don't always sound

85
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,880
like this so please bear with me start

86
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:30,490
like hacking up a long but I'm super

87
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,690
excited that Politico technology cares

88
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,630
so much about technology that they

89
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,490
wanted to start their own Meetup and

90
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,860
it's really exciting to be a part of it

91
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,800
from an HR and talent acquisition

92
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,630
standpoint I love being in recruiting

93
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,310
and helping with tech recruiting is it I

94
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:50,860
get to live vicariously through you people

95
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:52,360
that do really cool stuff but of course

96
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,180
I have to do the shameless plug about

97
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,940
Politico and I know a lot of people

98
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,409
think they probably hire a lot of

99
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,210
journalists or I get like "Oh you work at Politico

100
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:03,400
you must be a reporter and I'm like no

101
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,470
I'm in HR but we also have a really

102
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,990
awesome technology team and I would love

103
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,169
for you guys to think about maybe some

104
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,340
career Politico at some point online or

105
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:14,800
even just keeping in touch with me I

106
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,330
left out my business cards by the pizza

107
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,330
if you want to pick it up connect with

108
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,550
me on LinkedIn. You definitely don't have to. The

109
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,020
other thing is if you guys are like 

110
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,889
putting this stuff on social we'd love

111
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:32,560
for you to tweet at us or tag us on

112
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:36,539
social @politicocareers 

113
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,539
So with that said it's all I got

114
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,340
[Music]

115
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:44,229
all right

116
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,509
so as Chris mentioned my name is Ben

117
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:49,270
Hong and so today we are here to talk

118
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:52,030
about vue.js 101 for those of you that

119
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,099
have your laptop's out if you follow

120
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,479
this URL you will get actually like live

121
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,759
updates of the slides as I go through

122
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,960
them so that all helped you guys follow

123
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,789
through with that said let's get started

124
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,219
so the first question obviously is what

125
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:08,110
is view Jas and you know the short and

126
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:09,789
simple answer is that it's another

127
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,830
client-side framework in sort of the

128
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:15,099
massive ecosystem that we already have

129
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,090
but it's it's special and so in order to

130
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:18,300
give a little context with that we're

131
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,409
gonna kind of step back a little bit and

132
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,909
when client-side framework were starting

133
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:23,050
to get really popular this is around

134
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:25,180
time I started getting back into

135
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,029
front-end development there was a sort

136
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,699
of issue of like there are so many to

137
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:31,630
choose from that before you knew it you

138
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,310
know

139
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,200
they were sort of running jokes already

140
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,990
about how often we were coming out with

141
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,890
new tools or frameworks for JavaScript

142
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:44,530
and it kind of became a bear but even in

143
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:47,350
this sort of massive ecosystem this guy

144
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,090
named Avenue decides you know he is

145
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,710
gonna build its own as well so he

146
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,810
originally worked at Google creative

147
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,810
labs and so had some work working with

148
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,760
meteor working with angular as well and

149
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,980
then after angular one in particular and

150
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,330
after working with it for a while he he

151
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,440
felt like you know what I can build

152
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:07,630
something better like most of our and so

153
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,360
his brainchild is Vijay s all by his

154
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,790
little lonesome and so there's this

155
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,170
popular xkcd comic you know with the

156
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,550
fact that every time there's a problem

157
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,980
instead of trying to fix the original

158
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,950
one we come up with some new new

159
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,060
solution for it but the UJS is special

160
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,280
in this regard and I would say that its

161
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,380
exception to this and so obviously the

162
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,650
question is what makes it so special

163
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,480
and so let by to illustrate this we're

164
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,760
gonna compare it to so the two behemoths

165
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,740
in the client side favorite industry so

166
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,240
we have angular particularly we talk

167
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,980
about angular 1 just because that's

168
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,060
around the time that view came out so

169
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,710
obviously developed and maintained by

170
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,210
Google it was really easy to get

171
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,490
something prototype up and running

172
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,140
really quickly however the problem was

173
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,540
that a lot of it was like a mat there

174
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,950
was a lot of magical angular syntax so

175
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,900
when it came to actually debugging what

176
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,430
was going on you it was a pretty high

177
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,730
learning curve just to kind of get into

178
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,570
the weeds of what was going on

179
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,640
performance wasn't the best with angular

180
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,050
one at the time as well and it was

181
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,130
really opinionated on how you should

182
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,360
build your app and that's not

183
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,820
necessarily a bad thing even though I

184
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,950
put it as a con however it does restrict

185
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,110
teams as far as like opting out or

186
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,430
opting into certain technologies and so

187
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,050
it's just something that angular had

188
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:20,050
that others didn't

189
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,970
as far as react goes so as he developed

190
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,130
by Facebook and was recently granted the

191
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,890
MIT license which was a big win for the

192
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:29,170
open-source community and it had great

193
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,180
performance due to the proliferation of

194
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,820
the virtual Dom and so now most people

195
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,919
nowadays know what that is because of

196
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,510
react and the other thing I liked a lot

197
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,610
about react is that you got a lot better

198
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,040
at vanilla JavaScript really quickly

199
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,750
because unlike angular which provides

200
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,430
you a lot of sort of magical commands to

201
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,750
do things you had to write everything

202
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,330
well you have to write a lot of things

203
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,760
from scratch when it came to react on

204
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,870
the other hand the downside to this is

205
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,250
that there was a really high learning

206
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,930
curve as far as getting started if you

207
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,450
were not a JavaScript developer to start

208
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,890
it could it was a lot to deal with as

209
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,120
far as like oh used to configure web

210
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:04,390
pack and then have to do this bundler

211
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,210
and then you know it so yeah that was

212
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,680
kind of a rough start with react and as

213
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,510
well as a result this is really

214
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,800
unfriendly to non JavaScript developers

215
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,970
especially if people come to like the

216
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,380
design world where their HTML CSS

217
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,660
specialist and they want to kind of come

218
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,790
in and help out with the default

219
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,580
template language of JSX is just you

220
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,740
can't just you know post paste regular

221
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:28,140
markup into it you have to like convert

222
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:30,070
it into JavaScript friendly syntax and

223
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,390
you know the other thing especially in

224
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,790
this earlier days because there was such

225
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,990
a high pace of development you never

226
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,520
knew when you upgraded your react

227
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,780
whether or not certain dependencies or

228
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,420
libraries were going to break as a

229
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,010
result so this you know sort of like one

230
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,480
of the things I was a cautionary tale as

231
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:47,320
far as like when using an upgrading

232
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,390
react now view on the other hand it has

233
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,960
no corporate influence and clearly open

234
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:56,080
source so the the reason this is a pro

235
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,640
is because unlike Facebook they had the

236
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,470
parse developer platform at one point

237
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,270
and one day they decide to just close it

238
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,430
down and that that hurt a lot of

239
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,780
different people whereas so with view we

240
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,740
know there's open source and that we

241
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,600
don't have to worry about a company

242
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,400
deciding because it's in its best own

243
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,260
best interest that they're going to like

244
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,930
shut it down so that's a nice pro about

245
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,580
it after working I've worked a lot with

246
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,320
it react a little bit with angular and

247
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,090
as far as I can tell it really does take

248
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,470
the best of both worlds and brings them

249
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,700
together and a huge Pro because you know

250
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,560
we have developers on our team that

251
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,850
again are not JavaScript experts and in

252
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,620
fact tried to touch it as little as

253
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,840
possible so the fact that it doesn't a

254
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,940
liate non JavaScript developers is a

255
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,880
huge plus for us as well as you would

256
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,260
I'll show you shortly and as far as

257
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,600
performance goes it's pretty much on par

258
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:44,020
if not better than react as some tests

259
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,210
have shown and almost most importantly

260
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,100
it's very flexible in accommodating how

261
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,470
you prefer to build your apps so for

262
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,540
example with you know angular IO types

263
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,370
of it is pretty much mandatory well view

264
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,960
doesn't force you to do that but if you

265
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,940
want to opt in there is official support

266
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,960
for typescript and you have those

267
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,290
options to pick

268
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,820
as you're going through your view app

269
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,380
and then of course we got to find a con

270
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,000
somewhere and so it does have a small

271
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,430
core team in comparison in a smaller

272
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,050
community however as far as the pace of

273
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,330
development I've seen them sort of build

274
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:17,230
all the core modules and libraries at a

275
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:19,870
pretty great pace so with that said I'm

276
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,220
sure of you're like you know as a saying

277
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,460
goes show me don't tell me

278
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:28,030
so let's go ahead and jump right into

279
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:32,620
the essentials of view so I'm going to

280
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:34,870
open this code pen right here and okay

281
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:38,470
so actually you know what I'm gonna use

282
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:43,030
this one instead so as you can see here

283
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:47,200
we have a flat HTML file this nothing

284
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:49,300
fancy about it right here you can see

285
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,430
I've had a basic just view app

286
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,080
configuration so normally when it has

287
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,700
like reacting angular nowadays most

288
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,840
people are used to this process where

289
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,850
you have to install the command line

290
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,190
tool and then you have to run web pack

291
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,840
and everything well as the slide and

292
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,660
sort of as I mentioned it's really as

293
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,720
easy as including jQuery so we're gonna

294
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:10,060
go ahead and copy it and just like you

295
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:14,070
would normally you just you have your

296
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:21,250
script tag and your page or CDN and now

297
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:27,850
once I attach the element hook you can

298
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:32,260
see here now that when I update the HTML

299
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:34,450
syntax does it so in like two lines of

300
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,280
code you see here we have a functional

301
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,780
view app running on granted you know

302
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,130
you'll want to event to get Babel to

303
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,180
transpile and everything but as far as

304
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,700
like getting something up and running

305
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,990
it's it's up and running as you can see

306
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,200
here for those aren't familiar with it

307
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,880
view does use the much tests in tax kind

308
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,130
of out of the box I'm you can certainly

309
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,260
change it to other signifiers if you

310
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:58,000
want but as you can see that was pretty

311
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:59,500
simple to do okay so for those of us

312
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,020
that aren't as familiar with client-side

313
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,970
frameworks so what I did there is let's

314
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,500
let's kind of take a step back and break

315
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,790
it down so the first thing we do is we

316
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,650
initialize an instance right I'm

317
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,050
declaring an app variable here and

318
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,819
initializing view nothing too special

319
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,289
and so we're going to abstract it

320
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:15,819
a little bit out for those that aren't

321
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:17,129
as submitted with JavaScript and we're

322
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:20,109
going to pretend we're planning a trip

323
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,339
and so we have this new trip and we're

324
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:22,839
gonna do we're gonna map out all like

325
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:24,579
the important details we want to do on

326
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,859
this trip so you know we want to go to

327
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:28,569
you know Diagon Alley and then you know

328
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:31,209
within our luggage we're gonna carry you

329
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:32,439
know these various things and then when

330
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:33,789
it comes of things to do these are the

331
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:37,239
things we want to do when it comes to

332
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:40,989
our trip and so the first thing we have

333
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:43,149
to do with any good configuration is

334
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:45,819
determining as we said the destination

335
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:47,559
and so in your configuration object this

336
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:49,720
is determined by you know Al which

337
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:51,729
stands for element and it takes a CSS

338
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,859
selector which we which the best

339
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:55,089
practice is to use an ID so that you

340
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:59,470
only have one instance of your app

341
00:13:55,089 --> 00:14:01,569
running on any given page once you do

342
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,579
that then your luggage ultimately

343
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:04,899
becomes your is your data object and

344
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:08,049
this is what we're going to reach into

345
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:12,789
to reference as we throughout as we work

346
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:14,559
in our HTML template and as far as our

347
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:16,809
things to do this is ultimately our

348
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,419
methods block this is going to sort of

349
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:21,699
have enabled the app to do different

350
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:26,350
things according to what we want as we

351
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:32,759
define them so instead of so let's let's

352
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:35,970
take a look at this in action all right

353
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:39,249
so as you can see here once again I have

354
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,739
very simple you know again just straight

355
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:44,309
HTML nothing special about this and I've

356
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:47,049
already included the script here and

357
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:49,569
I've copied over the code that we had in

358
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:51,129
the slide example and so let's go ahead

359
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:53,769
and start wiring some of the stuff up so

360
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:58,449
is see so we have our static name

361
00:14:53,769 --> 00:15:00,879
so again just using much testing tax

362
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:03,850
okay so something's not working right

363
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,439
and so what's going on 99% of the time

364
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,029
it's because you forgot to attach your

365
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:08,949
app which is what I didn't do as you can

366
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:10,479
see here the element is diagonally and

367
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:15,720
we don't have an element on here that

368
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:18,999
has that so once I attach that on

369
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,649
voila now you have your data running so

370
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:25,439
I'm gonna go ahead and let's go ahead

371
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:25,439
and swap in the mess with data here

372
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:42,290
all right great and then I'm gonna go

373
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:47,310
ahead and fill these yep let me go back

374
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:58,970
so it slides calm slash Ben codes n /

375
00:15:47,310 --> 00:16:04,639
UJS 101 the essentials / live good okay

376
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:06,839
jump back alright okay you're welcome

377
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,060
so as we can see here I'm going to go

378
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,350
ahead and wire up a couple more things

379
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:23,370
so we have our wallet here and we'll

380
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:27,029
reference this alright so as you can see

381
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,579
here we have hooked up our basic Harry

382
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:35,760
Potter world app with the data model

383
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:37,410
here with you alright so before we can

384
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,820
move on to the next stuff that was more

385
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,360
interesting we need to talk about

386
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,850
directives and so directives are the one

387
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,320
part of you that is kind of magical and

388
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,600
for those of you the bots and angular

389
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,290
it's gonna be you guys don't know what

390
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,630
I'm talking about

391
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,370
ultimately what they are are view

392
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,470
specific methods that allow you to a

393
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,730
comment accomplish common goals that

394
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,920
abstract away sort of the implementation

395
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,260
piece and so here you have a list of

396
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,690
like sort of common directives that we

397
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,890
have in view the most popular ones and

398
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,709
the ones we're going to cover are the

399
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,030
ones on the left hand side and so as you

400
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,709
can see they're all prefixed with the V

401
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,839
dash in order to ensure that it doesn't

402
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:17,010
collide with anything else in your

403
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:20,100
application so starting with the V

404
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,900
if-else elsif and V show they these are

405
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,390
directives that ultimately toggle the

406
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,150
visibility of your elements but there is

407
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:30,150
one key distinction between them the V

408
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:33,540
if and the VLC if they actually destroy

409
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,860
the element on the page and like they

410
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,960
made sure all the event handlers and

411
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,060
everything are eliminated whereas V show

412
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,900
is really just a CSS toggle

413
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:45,330
and so to show you that real quick we

414
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,580
have our little parchment here so I'm

415
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,940
gonna go ahead and actually make you up

416
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:58,080
an element inspector all right so here

417
00:17:50,940 --> 00:18:01,580
is our parchment right here and then so

418
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,740
if I do V V if and I just declare false

419
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:08,460
you will see that the element is

420
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,380
completely gone from there it's nowhere

421
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,240
to be found it's actually destroyed Dom

422
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,100
element and thus nowhere is not the

423
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,250
you're not able to reference it on the

424
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:25,550
other hand if you use the v-- show false

425
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:25,550
you'll notice that the truthers

426
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:38,700
and you do the false it actually just

427
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:45,239
uses a CSS to toggle the hiding it so

428
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:49,110
actually let me switch as you can see

429
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:50,580
here style display:none and then again

430
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,899
just actually I realize those in another

431
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:57,840
iframe when I just showed you this

432
00:18:51,899 --> 00:19:03,059
earlier so V else on the other the if on

433
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,470
the other hand it's completely gone and

434
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,389
so those are the main differences

435
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,190
between them usually if you're gonna

436
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:10,019
toggle frequently as far as like

437
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,330
visibility goes then you're gonna want

438
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:13,379
me show otherwise V if is the most

439
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,059
common one you're gonna be using for

440
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:20,970
kind of removing and adding elements

441
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:23,429
back into the Dom there is this tweet I

442
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:26,129
saw by Sam who works at Google and it

443
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,869
says a 97% or 99% of software

444
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:30,029
development in one requirement is that a

445
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:33,960
user should be able to view view a list

446
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:37,019
of items and so luckily view has a

447
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,340
directive for that and that is v4 and as

448
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:40,830
you can see here in this simple example

449
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,679
it takes what you would normally have to

450
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:47,009
very tediously like right out by hand if

451
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,889
you were sort of doing this right here

452
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:54,809
and it just condenses it all down into

453
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:56,669
one simple block and so like like we do

454
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,739
before let's go and show you the live

455
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:03,590
example with this one right here so let

456
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,590
me go ahead yeah sure

457
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,270
so in the instance of let's say you have

458
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,940
I don't know three different banners and

459
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,620
you want the first one to show up in the

460
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,230
event you have an error but you want a

461
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,330
default banner to show otherwise so that

462
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,890
could be a simple exempt us off the top

463
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,179
of my head they send you just you have a

464
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,130
default element that you would normally

465
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:37,429
show and then you have condition to

466
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:40,370
toggle it depending on yes that's right

467
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:42,770
so right so you would have your if

468
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:45,460
statement as we had before so let me go

469
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,809
ahead let me see if I can do this live

470
00:20:45,460 --> 00:21:11,350
all right so in this case we have this

471
00:20:47,809 --> 00:21:14,059
parchment true and okay here this okay

472
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,130
so as you can see here I have two Dom

473
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:30,010
elements here and me condense this down

474
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:33,049
did it too much sorry hang on a sec okay

475
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:34,760
so I have two Dom elements here we have

476
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:37,039
our V if true show this parchment

477
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,130
otherwise show the other parchment so

478
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,860
now if I toggle this to false there it

479
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,630
is it's not styled properly but you can

480
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,159
see it right here so that's essentially

481
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,690
what's going on and then you can have V

482
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,720
else--if to show again additional

483
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:54,980
conditions just like to continue that

484
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:59,150
chain of logic if you'd like yes so in

485
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:02,840
this case yeah so like again this is uh

486
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:07,090
I don't know let's see uh wallet

487
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,090
galleons is greater than 20

488
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:24,450
okay so in this case wallet galleons is

489
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,870
not 20 because I set it at 12 so I'm

490
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:30,600
gonna treat that so now you can see now

491
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:37,920
you have here let me get this color

492
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:40,380
white so that is there you go so you can

493
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,970
see here it went through the first vfvf

494
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,770
condition which I declared a false

495
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,540
immediately then went to check the

496
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,280
second one to make sure if the Y

497
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,170
galleons was greater and since it was

498
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,170
then it showed this and then in the

499
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:58,500
event it's not then it will run all the

500
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:59,880
way down to the final one yeah ideally

501
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,070
you want your Fiat to be the first one

502
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,150
and then else it's all in the middle and

503
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:08,460
then your else at the very bottom it is

504
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,840
really sort of like for legibility it

505
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,530
helps to kind of keep it in that order

506
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,530
yeah

507
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:38,050
I believe it will break we can test it

508
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:38,050
right yeah yeah I don't think it'll run

509
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,030
yeah it looks like it does have to be in

510
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,970
a specific order yep

511
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,410
any other questions sorry yeah always

512
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,970
feel free to flag me in case you have a

513
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:55,520
question I'd get little heads down

514
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:57,980
sometimes okay so let's go back right we

515
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,650
were talking about the V for loop so

516
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,630
here we have sort of our galleons and so

517
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,920
earlier you saw that what I did was I

518
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:09,350
manually went in there to change the

519
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,420
lists itself and again for like three

520
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,620
items it's kind of not a big deal but in

521
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,890
the event this was you know again like a

522
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,480
list of 100 items this would get pretty

523
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:21,800
unbearable pretty quickly so let's go

524
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:24,080
ahead and refactor this using the v4 so

525
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,850
essentially you put your v4 on the HTML

526
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,430
element that you actually want to repeat

527
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:33,080
so we're gonna v4 and we're gonna

528
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:36,350
declare we want the okay so I have an

529
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,540
object so the syntax here is we have the

530
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:43,340
amount so you have your value and your

531
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:45,200
key which is the label and in wallet so

532
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,770
I'll explain this real quick what I'm

533
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,620
doing in a second okay so as you can see

534
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,480
here in my data object I have this

535
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,180
wallet object here and so what I'm

536
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,910
telling you to do is let me just put

537
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,860
numbers here is I'm telling for for

538
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:04,880
every item in wallet I want you to go

539
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:12,860
ahead and output these labels so again

540
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:17,510
we're gonna use the the mustache syntax

541
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:20,840
and that's it now you've sort of

542
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:22,400
eliminated all that redundancy and very

543
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,940
clean very semantic and you know what's

544
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,940
going on yeah

545
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:38,950
yep yeah so there are so those are one

546
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,540
of the advanced hop was you can have add

547
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,630
filters like custom filters for like

548
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:47,980
highlighting title casing you could also

549
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:50,170
this is so I wonder between the

550
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,150
handlebar syntax it it should be

551
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,590
actually rendering the actual inline

552
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,970
JavaScript so you could write inline

553
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,220
JavaScript in there if you wanted to to

554
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:03,450
like do that but obviously there are

555
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:03,450
cleaner ways of doing that in view okay

556
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,580
computer methods is different from data

557
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,620
yeah that's something that we will get

558
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,600
to in like the 201 but that's how to do

559
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,820
is sort of how data is being updated as

560
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,120
like the most of the life cycle

561
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:21,310
yeah but filters are just again in her

562
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,530
case you would do something like title

563
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,330
case and so label would pass through

564
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,740
this this filter that I'd build called

565
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,750
title case it would take the string and

566
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:32,950
it would like make the first case first

567
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:34,600
letter uppercase so be an example there

568
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,770
are some built-in ones but most of the

569
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,220
time we're gonna be building your own as

570
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,220
far as I'm aware

571
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,450
so again yeah another popular one would

572
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,560
be like thing and we'll just want to be

573
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,370
like currency if you want to turn just

574
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:54,340
like US dollars that's another way

575
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:56,680
okay so let's I see we were okay so now

576
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,530
that we've covered v4 let's talk about V

577
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,940
pine so all this data manipulation is

578
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,710
nice but a lot of times what we need to

579
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,650
do is actually update HTML attributes

580
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,540
and so view provides us a directive V

581
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,240
bind as you can see here the long way of

582
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,740
writing in is V - pine with a semicolon

583
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,830
and then whatever attribute you want

584
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,910
whether its source title doesn't matter

585
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,720
I'll be using the shortcut way and this

586
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,280
is probably the way you're gonna be

587
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,580
seeing in most commonly in code bases

588
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:26,530
where you just prefix the attribute you

589
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:28,360
want with the semicolon and then and

590
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:30,250
then after that it's gonna be rendering

591
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,880
JavaScript so to show you what I mean by

592
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:39,100
that we are go so I've already defined

593
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,480
in the css3 different classes for

594
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,950
the wallet so you can see a galleon

595
00:27:40,480 --> 00:28:03,430
sickles nuts and they just get a color

596
00:27:41,950 --> 00:28:07,900
very simple yeah sure yep right here so

597
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:10,620
this I should so it's bound by actually

598
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,940
JavaScript syntax and so as far as just

599
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:16,360
when you do a for loop normally what you

600
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,920
want to do is in an object you yeah

601
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,630
normally it does like the value but in

602
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,850
case you want to include the key then

603
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,410
the key always comes second in that so

604
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,420
like the standard JavaScript syntax if

605
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,740
I'm not mistaken so that's the reason

606
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,450
why it's a mount label and that label

607
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,560
amount because normally you're looping

608
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:37,300
through the value and not necessarily

609
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:40,360
the key yep okay so we were about to

610
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:42,550
alright we're gonna show you V bind so I

611
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,770
want to attach any class to each of

612
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,150
these l eyes but I don't again I want to

613
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:49,060
do that in a dynamic way and not have to

614
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:52,360
manually code it so I'm going to go

615
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:54,670
ahead and declare the be bind class and

616
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,010
I'm going to just okay so the moment you

617
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:58,780
attach the V bind the stuff in between

618
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,400
your string is actually going to be

619
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,830
inline JavaScript it's not actually

620
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,690
parsing like a real string so in this

621
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,550
case I'm going to use label that I

622
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,960
referred to sort of in this loop and as

623
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:11,620
you can see here immediately

624
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,750
it applies the various classes that I

625
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,240
want for it galleons tickles nuts all

626
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:19,080
they're all done and so you can do this

627
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,430
with you know again any HTML attribute

628
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,720
you know styles and you can do some

629
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,060
really cool things as far as dynamic

630
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,160
updating and we'll have some fun sort of

631
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:31,150
code sandbox things for you guys to try

632
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:37,740
later on any questions about be binds so

633
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:40,960
far okay yes pretty straightforward

634
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,240
finally we have the V on and so as in

635
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,860
addition to manipulating data and your

636
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,370
attributes you obviously want to attach

637
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:50,950
event handlers and so you have your V on

638
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,450
and then there's a bunch of your

639
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,130
JavaScript events

640
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,750
so the shorthand for this one for Veon

641
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,030
is your at symbol and that's what we'll

642
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:02,920
be using moving forward and so I'm gonna

643
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:05,050
go back to the button here and so for

644
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,910
this when the button is clicked I want

645
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:10,420
to attach this method fired confetti

646
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:18,390
that I wrote down here so on click fire

647
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:20,890
and study and then I cook it magic yay

648
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:25,390
and that's all that's all there was to

649
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:28,440
it and so again very clean easy to read

650
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,440
easy to track ah

651
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:37,150
so right here the dooty dooty why did I

652
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,980
lose it right here so I did the app

653
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,900
click fire confetti and so this is

654
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,970
something that I already sort of set up

655
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,540
beforehand it's just like a JavaScript

656
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:50,890
function that again creates the confetti

657
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:53,980
so that's V on and those and then let's

658
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:57,070
see ah I have one more V model so this

659
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:59,230
is views pretty much single way of using

660
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,520
two-way data-binding and obviously as

661
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,710
far as state management goes for those

662
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,080
are aren't familiar with it single

663
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:07,390
statement single state flow is pretty

664
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,160
much like sorry unidirectional data flow

665
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,470
is sort of the popular method now but

666
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,810
the model does allow us to use two-way

667
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:17,380
data-binding if we need it and so back

668
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:21,160
to the button example we it's as simple

669
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:23,230
as typing V model equals and then the

670
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:27,930
data attribute that you want to tie to

671
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,930
and in this case would be message so now

672
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:34,810
sorry do I have it twice

673
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,650
oh hey left it in there when I was

674
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:42,970
playing around with it you're right okay

675
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:47,530
so yes so the V model here as we can see

676
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:49,030
is now is showing in the placeholder is

677
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,950
actually showing the value of this is

678
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:55,540
easy and then when you update it with

679
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:57,340
whatever you want you can see it's just

680
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:01,570
dynamically updating the data property

681
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:05,400
on the page so very simple very powerful

682
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,400
and just good to know

683
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:12,200
so there are event buses and view X

684
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,360
which is centrally used version of redux

685
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:22,010
and that is a topic we'll get into in

686
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:24,110
another time date okay so with that said

687
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:26,990
let's take a quick five minute break for

688
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:28,910
anyone you need to grab a drink or you

689
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,410
know yeah I get something to eat and

690
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,750
then for those with laptops you want to

691
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,160
try the final coding exercise we're

692
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,540
gonna have I'm gonna have some basic

693
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,830
tasks for you to just sort of practice

694
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:47,560
what we just went over and then yep so

695
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:47,560
we'll be back into the five minutes okay

696
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:53,780
so uh I thought it's best to obviously

697
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,280
give people some practice with what

698
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,920
we're learning so you guys can actually

699
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,590
reinforce what you're doing so as far as

700
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,940
the exercise we have just like your

701
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,370
basic for those who watch we can more to

702
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:06,980
basic Rick generator this is the final

703
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,380
product as you can see here I can go

704
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,380
ahead and type whatever I want in this

705
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,780
text input it'll update these down in

706
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,130
here and then in the event I want to you

707
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,590
know copy an image link from somewhere

708
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:22,340
it'll also paste in and then so let's

709
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:37,910
just do that real quick let's try let's

710
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:42,800
do strawberries and then I can click and

711
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:44,480
reposition in his face so that's so this

712
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:49,220
is what we'll sort of be building sort

713
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,990
of for the rest of the Meetup and so

714
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,660
your first so this is your starter pen

715
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,880
and your first task will break it up

716
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,830
into segments and so go ahead and

717
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,200
replace the pickle word with the actual

718
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:03,290
I cook it up with the noun probably the

719
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,660
same data and and make sure that's wired

720
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:08,150
up correctly so that you are dynamic and

721
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:10,490
dynamically updated in the text box as I

722
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,870
showed you earlier and then also go

723
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:14,600
ahead and wire up the background image

724
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:17,150
and so I'll give you guys a couple

725
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,290
minutes to kind of take a look and see

726
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,570
what you can do

727
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:23,690
and then I'll cut along with you guys

728
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:26,480
afterwards so I won't there were too

729
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,040
much of the wall okay for those of you

730
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,149
to keep work working on your own go

731
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,310
ahead and keep going I'm gonna go ahead

732
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:33,080
and start coding so everyone else

733
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,330
doesn't have a laptop can follow along

734
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,250
so our first task we have for this

735
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:40,639
exercise is to replace pickle with a

736
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:45,250
dynamic data property now so as we can

737
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,540
see here we have configured a new app

738
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,820
however we had not lifted up yet so

739
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:54,200
we're gonna hook up the main div class

740
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:56,149
with app ID and then the next thing

741
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,980
we're going to do is let's go ahead and

742
00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:02,510
write something in here is this color

743
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:04,550
like cucumber and the solution of this

744
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:09,470
if you're gonna use our mustache syntax

745
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:12,350
and we're gonna like now in here now we

746
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:16,190
have dynamic dynamic property updating

747
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:18,980
within our HTML template pretty

748
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:22,250
straightforward task number two was to

749
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:25,820
none hook up this input to dynamically

750
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:27,860
update the non-property so all we got to

751
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:31,400
do is going to find this input and its

752
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,810
input noun right here and this is

753
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,750
anything so we're gonna use two-way

754
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:37,580
data-binding for this one go to the view

755
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:50,420
model and we're gonna attach it to our

756
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:51,860
noun property and finally we wanted to

757
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,070
tie in the background image this is

758
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:57,100
probably the this is the trickier part

759
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:59,960
so let's go ahead and first define a

760
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:02,920
background image or I think actually in

761
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,830
the exercise I felt like if you're all

762
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:11,330
and so what I'm gonna do now is I'm

763
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:13,130
gonna go to see it is okay so the reason

764
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,600
I put this in line now Craig it normally

765
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,690
with most your HTML code you're not

766
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,310
gonna actually put your your Styles in

767
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,840
line the reason we're doing it in this

768
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:23,750
case is because we're gonna make use of

769
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:27,320
the V bind property to make this dynamic

770
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:31,480
and so what we want to do here is we're

771
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:33,430
going to so this piece right here is

772
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,840
pickle so we're gonna go ahead and you

773
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,820
know just make sure it works in the face

774
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:40,210
of them here and so now we have to

775
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:43,180
rewrite this and so the gotcha

776
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:45,970
with dynamic styles with distribution is

777
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:48,220
that it needs to be written in an object

778
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:51,670
syntax so this is what is more like

779
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,410
JavaScript JavaScript styling so your

780
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:57,370
background image now has to be in this

781
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:59,740
channel case and then because it's

782
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:01,330
trying to interpret the URL as a

783
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:05,170
variable you have to actually wrap it in

784
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:08,730
a string so this is a string and we're

785
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:08,730
going to add something to it shortly

786
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,160
okay so this looks a little convoluted

787
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:47,260
but I will show you what I'm doing a

788
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:47,260
second all right

789
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:09,120
there's it uh URL plus oh there's a one

790
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,050
more tick here yeah you're probably

791
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:14,910
right well this is why we have I figure

792
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,630
out the solution just to reference it in

793
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,630
case something went wrong

794
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:35,780
right

795
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:37,490
yeah this is dissonant allergic okay so

796
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,930
once again less let me let me one line

797
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:46,579
this so this is easier for everyone to

798
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:49,280
read so as you can see here were we're

799
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:51,410
using the V vine on the style and once

800
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,940
again it's going to take in a JavaScript

801
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,619
object that's a post your normal like

802
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,109
inline CSS where you have your normal

803
00:38:54,619 --> 00:39:00,260
casing so we have our object right here

804
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:01,609
that's marked here and here and then we

805
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,130
declare our CSS property we want to

806
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:06,920
change this background image and then

807
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,510
once again because URL we want to as a

808
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,099
string and not as like to interpret out

809
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:13,040
the variable we have to wrap this in

810
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:15,859
single single quotations and then we

811
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,619
again we drop in our data object right

812
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:20,180
here in image URL and then we close it

813
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:22,400
off with the press intact with the

814
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:25,640
string here and then close it off with

815
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,970
the object and now you have now we have

816
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,670
connected to image URL to it and then

817
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:33,260
similar to the noun 1 we are going to

818
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:37,819
attach a D model to the background image

819
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:39,410
and that we call the image URL so once

820
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:44,270
again let's go ahead and do that shot if

821
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:48,920
I paste in the strawberry URL there you

822
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:51,170
go that's how that works so again the

823
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,140
most convoluted piece of this is the

824
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:56,000
Gotcha which I failed to mention earlier

825
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,460
again when you're doing dynamic styling

826
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,109
it has to be a JavaScript CSS syntax not

827
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:06,069
straight CSS it's straight CSS any

828
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,069
questions about that so far

829
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,380
Phyllis

830
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:22,619
yep

831
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:27,780
yep I had an issue with that at one

832
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:28,200
point button maybe because of let's find

833
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,800
out

834
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,800
I do like yes

835
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,070
[Music]

836
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:56,900
so this is possible transpiling issue

837
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:05,520
possibly so the other way we could do

838
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,300
this actually if we wanted to make this

839
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,300
even easier on ourselves

840
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,600
let's declare it down here where we

841
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:24,680
don't have to deal with that up there so

842
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:24,680
you have this is an object that's good

843
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:43,839
so a six template literals do work in

844
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,579
some cases I think in this particular

845
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,660
case because of all the different mush

846
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:48,640
test syntax and everything running

847
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:51,130
around it's a little bit on the

848
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,960
complicated side so I will make a note

849
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,880
to come up with a demo that actually

850
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:08,259
works with that and get back to you on

851
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:09,700
that but that's a great question okay

852
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:16,900
any other questions for the first

853
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:20,769
exercise so going back now we're gonna

854
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,180
move on today we're going to use our

855
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:27,099
directives and methods that we can

856
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:31,420
practice doing that and so in the final

857
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:36,400
example that we have here you're able to

858
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:39,999
toggle the menu up here make it hidden

859
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,229
and show so you're welcome to use

860
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,660
whatever directives you'd like to use to

861
00:42:41,229 --> 00:42:45,549
accomplish that but that is your first

862
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,589
task and for those of you that a little

863
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:49,749
bit more gung-ho then you can go ahead

864
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:54,479
and try and write your own method that

865
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:57,489
then allows you to dynamically update

866
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:59,400
the position of this face depending on

867
00:42:57,489 --> 00:43:02,049
where you need it to be on the image and

868
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,640
it's gonna be as you can see here and

869
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:05,019
it's just a preview distribution it's

870
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,779
gonna be a little bit tricky because you

871
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:11,049
have to we're gonna using a V bind on

872
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:18,069
your style and updating some of the

873
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:23,759
absolute position of it so if that said

874
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:30,279
let me cue up the slides again and I

875
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:31,509
will leave I'll leave the JSP saw so in

876
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:34,170
case anyone wants a reference if they're

877
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:34,170
trying to figure it out

878
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:53,910
if there are any questions please let me

879
00:43:37,920 --> 00:44:03,660
know you know and you around like back

880
00:43:53,910 --> 00:44:05,190
tick okay go great

881
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,750
yeah that's an awesome fine you had a

882
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:19,230
yeah had them too early

883
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:19,890
yep yes yep so as far as yeah that's a

884
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,960
great question

885
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,970
as far as best practices go you should

886
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,860
turn it into a function it returns a new

887
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:28,020
object every time as far as like state

888
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:29,970
management goes for the purpose of this

889
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,410
exercise you don't have to do that it

890
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:34,590
should just work out of the box if you

891
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:39,020
prefer to as a complaint object but Evan

892
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:42,660
did recently come out with standards

893
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:44,370
people having checked out the docs he

894
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,990
has saga that I she came out which is

895
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,400
pretty great and he essentially has

896
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,590
these rule categories where he

897
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,090
prioritizes certain things that you

898
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,620
really should be doing any of you have

899
00:44:51,090 --> 00:45:07,590
this best practices and that's one of

900
00:44:52,620 --> 00:45:10,260
them which is so he said like he would

901
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,850
prefer that we all use functions but for

902
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,320
the purposes of like illustrating sort

903
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:16,460
of everything's working I kept

904
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,460
everything object to say

905
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:31,170
correct yep mm-hmm yep absolutely

906
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:32,580
great question all right so let's again

907
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:38,250
for those working feel free to continue

908
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:44,960
on suicide okay okay sorry I have the

909
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:49,410
final one up switch over okay

910
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:53,760
so our first test was to toggle this

911
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:55,410
piece and since we're gonna be toggling

912
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,760
on and off pretty frequently what I'm

913
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,369
going to do is I'm going to use the V

914
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:02,130
show directive again gonna use BL B if

915
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:05,730
that would have worked as well so for

916
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:07,940
the side menu here which is the wrapper

917
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:11,510
for this I like it

918
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:13,740
you'll do the V show and in this case

919
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:16,410
again let's make sure it works V show

920
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,970
false great so we're gonna do that we're

921
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:21,090
gonna have a dynamic property to manage

922
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:23,940
the state put up and so we're gonna call

923
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:26,400
that you know show side menu and I'm

924
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:28,680
gonna call that default doctor too and

925
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:33,270
so just to make sure that works we're

926
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:37,890
going to then say okay so side hey there

927
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:41,550
you go it works so now we want to attach

928
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:44,520
our event handler to the button in order

929
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:45,720
to toggle that back and forth so we're

930
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,950
gonna go look for that button and that

931
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,950
is right here

932
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:59,190
the pocket button and you do this on a

933
00:46:49,950 --> 00:47:01,260
single line so that's easy to do so in

934
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:03,240
this event what we want to do we want to

935
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,640
listen for a click event right so at

936
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,680
click very simple and so I'm going to

937
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,570
show this the in line way and then we'll

938
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,130
refactor it back out so the easiest way

939
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:14,640
for us to do this is we're gonna say

940
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:18,050
okay show side menu and we're gonna make

941
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,050
it equal to nachos

942
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:30,660
yeah I can toggle back and forth so this

943
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:32,270
works okay for obviously shorter

944
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:35,190
inline JavaScript that you don't need

945
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:36,870
anything complicated for but let's just

946
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,340
say for instance this was like you know

947
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:41,340
a few lines of code that we need to

948
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:44,760
refactor so in this case you would just

949
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:47,700
declare your methods config and so we're

950
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:51,480
gonna call this you know toggle side

951
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:55,340
menu that's our function and then we're

952
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:59,370
going to go ahead like this right here

953
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:02,910
drop it in then we're gonna do toggles

954
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:06,810
side right this should work right

955
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:12,510
that doesn't yes that's right

956
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:17,580
it needs context and we need this so can

957
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:20,010
you do like this is fine okay so now you

958
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:22,200
we have positive on and off and again

959
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:27,540
this would have worked just for picking

960
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:29,070
it'll be if again since we're talking

961
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,090
about or not frequently and we don't

962
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,470
want to actually have to recreate

963
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:33,360
everything all at once we took on

964
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:39,030
visibility thing we show is the more

965
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:41,370
appropriate one to use okay so we're

966
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:42,240
gonna spend let's say about five to ten

967
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:44,910
minutes sort of talking about the

968
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,830
challenge number ways of doing this and

969
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:50,370
I just sort of thought I'd come up with

970
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:51,540
a fun one so in the final exercise again

971
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:53,700
what we could do is we could click

972
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:58,560
anywhere and it would update the

973
00:48:53,700 --> 00:49:00,180
position of Rick's face and so what I'm

974
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,480
gonna do is go ahead and just kind of

975
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:06,420
walk you through it it's like putting in

976
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,880
my complicated a little bit so

977
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:11,090
ultimately what we're doing here is

978
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,800
we're updating this template wrapper and

979
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:17,160
so I've absolutely positioned this whole

980
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:20,670
thing and I've declared the top and the

981
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:23,310
left with the Y and X data properties

982
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:25,650
and then you have to attach the pixels

983
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:28,170
just to give it a dimensions so that it

984
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:31,620
actually knows where to move and then

985
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:35,320
I'll explain why I define the width here

986
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:38,110
in a second so as far as what's going on

987
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:40,690
you'll see here that in the image

988
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:43,120
wrapper here we have a click right and

989
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:46,660
this click calls the update position

990
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:50,170
function you scroll down to update

991
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:58,120
position you'll see that what I do is I

992
00:49:50,170 --> 00:50:00,010
go ahead and I start by ok so when you

993
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,760
do a click event and you declare a

994
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:05,380
function on it you get past an event

995
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,870
parameter as part of it you don't have

996
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,640
to use it but in the case we do and so

997
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:11,230
ignoring these first these top two lines

998
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,300
essentially you'll see that I'm

999
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:16,330
dynamically updating the x and y

1000
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,410
properties with your event Kline Xing

1001
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:20,110
client Y and that's something you get

1002
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,430
for free when you as when you click on

1003
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:23,350
something so the client X tells you

1004
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:27,550
where your mouse is from the X and then

1005
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:28,930
Y essentially and then the reason why we

1006
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:32,080
have this piece right here as far as the

1007
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:37,120
wrapper width is because originally when

1008
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:39,970
I set this up the it anchors the div at

1009
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,350
the corner of it so essentially you'll

1010
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:43,450
notice that Rick's face is actually

1011
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:45,460
where my clicker is and so in order to

1012
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:46,660
position my mouse at there I had to

1013
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:49,690
essentially do a little bit of math as

1014
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,490
far as like sort of fixing it based on

1015
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:52,450
the width of the day of so that energy

1016
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,700
clicks on it

1017
00:50:52,450 --> 00:51:00,400
whereas like just to show you if I take

1018
00:50:54,700 --> 00:51:03,280
these two things off you'll notice now

1019
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,260
I'm at the corner which is fine like for

1020
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,940
demo purposes like but I kind of wanted

1021
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:12,550
to figure that out so that's why I have

1022
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:15,100
the wrapper with calculation here and I

1023
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:17,620
just defined the width in line on the

1024
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:20,770
HTML in order to access access the

1025
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:23,140
property with style with so and that

1026
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:26,010
allows me to click and then his face

1027
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:30,000
will be dead center on anywhere I click

1028
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:30,000
anyone have any questions about that

1029
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:37,290
ok

1030
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,290
solid

1031
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:45,160
let's unpack to the sides alright so as

1032
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,810
you guys can see there's a quote by Sir

1033
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,430
Dresner that I really liked in her

1034
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,020
course and she says you know view gives

1035
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:51,520
me what I want when I need it and then

1036
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,500
it gets out of my way and that's how I

1037
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,940
feel a lot when I work with you I'm like

1038
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,860
oh I want to hide something on my okay

1039
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,740
be if this all right now I'm moving on

1040
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:01,540
to something else

1041
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:03,550
well we recently built a an app and

1042
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,470
react native and so I can just tell you

1043
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,820
from personal experience just the hassle

1044
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:08,530
of trying to go back and rewrite

1045
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,780
functions to either remap things or

1046
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:12,730
reduce things it can it can be a bit

1047
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:15,990
much as far as management and so view is

1048
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:18,610
just it's really clean semantically and

1049
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:22,990
you know I just it's been great because

1050
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:24,340
of that uh so you know Congrats

1051
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:26,550
everybody we've essentially walked

1052
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:29,920
through three view applications in

1053
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:32,710
little over an hour and so you've gotten

1054
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,570
some practice as well but of course

1055
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:36,010
there's more this is just the 101 bare

1056
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:38,740
minimum essentials for getting something

1057
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:41,290
up and running as you can see here as

1058
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:42,580
some of you actually pointed out there

1059
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:44,590
are still a lot of things to talk about

1060
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:46,780
as far as computer properties filters

1061
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:49,240
props mix-ins I mean they're just a

1062
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,980
whole slew of things that view also

1063
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,740
provides for you when you're building

1064
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,120
your single page application and in the

1065
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,790
future we'll be having talks regarding

1066
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,260
these in the - one we're talking a bit

1067
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,270
about the concepts and then we'll have

1068
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,530
worked for specific talks to talk about

1069
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:04,510
you know app architecture

1070
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:06,400
testing managing Styles because

1071
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:08,890
obviously managing styles in Java skips

1072
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,260
is a hotly discussed topic in our realm

1073
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:13,780
so we'll have a talk about that and of

1074
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:15,670
course nowadays functional animation is

1075
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:17,080
the big deal so view does a beautiful

1076
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:18,760
job as far as managing those animations

1077
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:23,110
and so we will talk about that as well

1078
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:25,330
in the future and so as far as a sneak

1079
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:32,230
peek at vue.js 201 I wanted you guys to

1080
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:32,530
or Gary had suggested very sorry that's

1081
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:41,080
right

1082
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:42,520
Chris he suggested that we sort of show

1083
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,970
you guys so whenever you work over the

1084
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,589
meet zoom in if you guys do open a view

1085
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:49,029
code base in the future

1086
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:50,619
obviously people aren't working just

1087
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:51,969
like a single HTML file and then like

1088
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:54,819
writing everything in there that'd be

1089
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:56,440
impossible to manage and you just get

1090
00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:58,210
out of hand really quick so I just want

1091
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,650
to give you guys a sneak peek into 201

1092
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:02,259
where we start talking about the like

1093
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:04,630
view template file so you can see here

1094
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:07,900
instead of like dot HTML gesture dot CSS

1095
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:09,849
we have a dot view and it's comprised of

1096
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,200
three blocks and so just to make a

1097
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:13,329
little easier I'm gonna open BS code

1098
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:24,789
real quick just show you guys it's

1099
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:26,259
simple scaffold okay so it's comprised

1100
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:27,519
of that your view file is gonna be

1101
00:54:26,259 --> 00:54:29,229
comprised of three blocks whenever

1102
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,390
you're looking at it template pretty

1103
00:54:29,229 --> 00:54:33,819
straightforward this is your HTML

1104
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:35,109
template basic rule of thumb at the

1105
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:36,640
moment I don't think they've done this

1106
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:40,569
indeed yet but you can only have it can

1107
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:42,700
only return a single a single element

1108
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:44,410
you can't have two next to each other I

1109
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:48,369
think Pete react has already fixed this

1110
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:49,690
but I don't think you has yet and then

1111
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:51,069
obviously your script here is your basic

1112
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:55,180
JavaScript as you're used to in your

1113
00:54:51,069 --> 00:54:57,819
HTML and this is your style block for

1114
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,979
writing your CSS some cool things about

1115
00:54:57,819 --> 00:55:01,210
the style block just to mention is that

1116
00:54:59,979 --> 00:55:03,009
you can actually define the type of

1117
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:04,749
language you'd like to use and it'll

1118
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:07,089
actually you might need to install a

1119
00:55:04,749 --> 00:55:08,890
package or two but generally it's very

1120
00:55:07,089 --> 00:55:10,059
convenient to be able to just switch to

1121
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,380
the if you're like oh I really like

1122
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:12,609
stylize I'm just going to stylus you

1123
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:15,789
don't have to do anything special

1124
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:17,920
regarding that and even cooler is that

1125
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:19,809
you can just add a scope to attribute to

1126
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,690
your style tags and that will scope all

1127
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:23,859
your Styles to that component which is

1128
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:29,380
pretty cool and we'll talk more about

1129
00:55:23,859 --> 00:55:32,710
that in managing styles for view anyways

1130
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:35,069
so yep so this is like your basic

1131
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:37,509
architecture that you can see here and

1132
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:38,859
you can see that they've broken out into

1133
00:55:37,509 --> 00:55:41,380
different components so this is like the

1134
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:44,670
sneak peek here we've actually defined a

1135
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:47,710
component to use here to-do list and

1136
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:50,289
this will then essentially insert all

1137
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:52,299
the mark-up from in here so I guess it's

1138
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:53,559
pretty interesting as far as component

1139
00:55:52,299 --> 00:55:55,719
architecture goes I mean anyone working

1140
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:57,969
with modern day client frameworks are

1141
00:55:55,719 --> 00:56:01,320
familiar with this but it's just you

1142
00:55:57,969 --> 00:56:16,089
know do you has this as well

1143
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:18,160
so with that said yep idea yep that

1144
00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:19,690
allows you to scope things for example

1145
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,430
again like a button component you might

1146
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:23,560
want to scope the styles there instead

1147
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:25,540
of having this bloated CSS file and so

1148
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:32,320
again this is one of the reasons you

1149
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:33,609
might have a global style so it's it's

1150
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,080
nice from a performance standpoint just

1151
00:56:33,609 --> 00:56:39,000
to only give users what they need and

1152
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:39,000
not just like this gigantic CSS file

1153
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:56,260
exactly right which is pretty great and

1154
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:58,089
okay so as additional resources the

1155
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:59,470
vue.js Doc's are done remarkably well

1156
00:56:58,089 --> 00:57:01,210
Evan you and his team have done a great

1157
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:03,730
job as far as documenting and providing

1158
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,800
examples for what they do and as I

1159
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:08,200
mentioned before there's a style guide

1160
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,520
in case anybody missed it before and so

1161
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,710
these are sort of essentially his like

1162
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,780
best practices recommendations for when

1163
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:15,070
you're writing a view app such as

1164
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,180
something to keep in mind it's in as you

1165
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:20,230
can see it's in beta so this is pretty

1166
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:22,300
new and then as far as people who like

1167
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:24,430
going through courses front-end masters

1168
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:27,339
has an introduction to view course by

1169
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:28,540
Sarah Dresner and she's awesome and so I

1170
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:30,280
just went do that just kind of see what

1171
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,440
she taught and definitely great one to

1172
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,790
check out and then for those who like

1173
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,770
sort of on-demand and you can like

1174
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:37,240
download them udemy is a great option as

1175
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:39,040
well you have a bunch of view J's

1176
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,869
courses on there the one in by

1177
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,339
Maximilian is the one I first took and

1178
00:57:40,869 --> 00:57:45,609
that's not kind of how I got into view

1179
00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:47,260
and but if you do go on udemy do not buy

1180
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:48,760
them full price they always have coupon

1181
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,710
codes to make them like ten dollars from

1182
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,109
the original two hundred dollars so do

1183
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:54,880
not buy them at full price and finally

1184
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:56,470
there is a view jeaious discord channel

1185
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:01,540
so feel free to join that it's totally

1186
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:03,070
free with that said there's footnotes so

1187
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:08,040
if case you want to check out Evan used

1188
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:08,040
story and yep that's it
